This allows you to develop your own blazing-fast lightweight VIM based IDE on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n## What systems can Anwar run on?\r\nAnwar has been developed to work on Ubuntu linux. Anwar also works with Ubuntu derivatives, which includes Ubuntu Kylin, Edubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Ubuntu MATE.\r\nThis is not an exhaustive list and Anwar should work on other Ubuntu derivatives too.\r\n\r\n## Anwar for IDE Building\r\nIf you would like to use Anwar, follow the steps given to download and start it.\r\n\r\n###Downloading Anwar\r\nExecute the following commands in sequence to download Anwar on your Ubuntu operating system.\r\n```sh\r\n# creating a new hidden directory\r\nmkdir ~/.anwar\r\n\r\n# navigating to the new directory\r\ncd ~/.anwar\r\n\r\n# downloading the executable from github to the new directory\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prabal1997/anwar-ide-cli-setup.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Starting Anwar\r\nExecute the following commands in sequence to start Anwar for use\r\n```sh\r\n# navigating to the correct directory\r\ncd ~/.anwar/anwar-ide-cli-setup\r\n\r\n# changing file permissions for Anwar\r\nchmod u+x anwar.out\r\n\r\n# running Anwar\r\n./anwar.out\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing to Anwar\r\nTo contribute to Anwar, create a new branch and then sumbit a merge request. Please understand that only valuable patches will be integrated into the master branch. Please read the following instructions to install pre-requisite compilers, clone this repository, understand the structure of Anwar, and to compile your build.\r\n\r\n###Installing Compilers\r\nAnwar uses 'C', 'C++', and 'BASH' programming languages to operate. While 'BASH' is a part of the Ubuntu operating system by default, 'C' and 'C++' compilers might not be available on some machines running Ubuntu and its derivatives. Use the following commands to install the compilers for 'C' and 'C++' programming languages.\r\n```sh\r\n# updating list of repositories\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n# installing 'C' compiler\r\nsudo apt-get install gcc\r\n\r\n#installing 'C++' compiler\r\nsudo apt-get install g++\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Downloading Anwar\r\n```sh\r\n# creating a new directory\r\nmkdir ~/anwar\r\n\r\n# navigating to the new directory\r\ncd ~/anwar\r\n\r\n# downloading Anwar inside the new directory\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prabal1997/anwar-ide-cli-setup.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Understanding Anwar\r\nAnwar has been developed in a highly modular way. Please Read the CONTRIBUTE.md file to understand the structure of Anwar.\r\n\r\n###Compiling & Executing Anwar\r\n```sh\r\n# navigate to the directory where Anwar is located\r\ncd ~/anwar/anwar-ide-cli-setup\r\n\r\n# compiling Anwar by listing every file with '.cpp' or '.h' extension after 'g++'\r\ng++ anwar.cpp anwar_head.h fwd_decl.h format.cpp ind_mdl.cpp pck_mdl.cpp \r\n\r\n# changing file permissions for Anwar\r\nchmod u+x a.out\r\n\r\n# running Anwar\r\n./a.out\r\n```\r\n\r\n##License\r\n'Anwar' is under Apache License Version 2.0.
