This allows you to develop your own blazing-fast lightweight VIM based IDE on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nYou can use Anwar to set up a new development environment in a matter of mere minutes, allowing you to practically set up any machine as your development hub - whether on the cloud, or the desktop.\r\n\r\n## What systems can Anwar run on?\r\nAnwar is compatible with Ubuntu and all its official flavours, including Ubuntu Kylin, Edubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Ubuntu MATE.\r\n\r\n![Ubuntu Flavours](http://i.imgur.com/E31M5rT.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is not an exhaustive list and Anwar should work on other Ubuntu derivatives too.\r\n\r\n## Anwar for IDE Building\r\nIf you would like to use Anwar, follow the steps given to download and start it.\r\n\r\n###Downloading Anwar\r\nExecute the following commands in sequence to download Anwar on your Ubuntu operating system.\r\n```sh\r\n# creating a new hidden directory\r\nmkdir ~/.anwar\r\n\r\n# navigating to the new directory\r\ncd ~/.anwar\r\n\r\n# downloading the executable from github to the new directory\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prabal1997/anwar-ide-cli-setup.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Starting Anwar\r\nExecute the following commands in sequence to start Anwar for use\r\n```sh\r\n# navigating to the correct directory\r\ncd ~/.anwar/anwar-ide-cli-setup\r\n\r\n# changing file permissions for Anwar\r\nchmod u+x anwar.out\r\n\r\n# running Anwar\r\n./anwar.out\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing to Anwar\r\nTo contribute to Anwar, create a new branch and then sumbit a pull request. Please understand that only valuable patches will be integrated into the master branch. Please read the following instructions to install pre-requisite compilers, clone this repository, understand the structure of Anwar, and to compile your build.\r\n\r\n###Installing Compilers\r\nAnwar uses 'C', 'C++', and 'BASH' programming languages to operate. While 'BASH' is a part of the Ubuntu operating system by default, 'C' and 'C++' compilers might not be available on some machines running Ubuntu and its derivatives. Use the following commands to install the compilers for 'C' and 'C++' programming languages.\r\n```sh\r\n# updating list of repositories\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\n\r\n# installing 'C' compiler\r\nsudo apt-get install gcc\r\n\r\n#installing 'C++' compiler\r\nsudo apt-get install g++\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Downloading Anwar\r\nExecute the following commands in sequence to download Anwar on your Ubuntu operating system.\r\n```sh\r\n# creating a new directory\r\nmkdir ~/anwar\r\n\r\n# navigating to the new directory\r\ncd ~/anwar\r\n\r\n# downloading Anwar inside the new directory\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prabal1997/anwar-ide-cli-setup.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Understanding Anwar\r\nAnwar has been developed in a highly modular way. Please read the introductory notes inside ```anwar.cpp ``` file to understand the structure of Anwar.\r\n\r\n###Compiling & Executing Anwar\r\n```sh\r\n# navigate to the directory where Anwar is located\r\ncd ~/anwar/anwar-ide-cli-setup\r\n\r\n# compiling Anwar by listing every file with '.cpp' or '.h' extension after 'g++'\r\ng++ anwar.cpp anwar_head.h fwd_decl.h format.cpp ind_mdl.cpp pck_mdl.cpp \r\n\r\n# changing file permissions for Anwar\r\nchmod u+x a.out\r\n\r\n# running Anwar\r\n./a.out\r\n```\r\n## Future\r\nAnwar will eventually have ```ncurses``` based GUI to simplify the program layout and flow. Moreover, development is undergoing to develop a release of Anwar compatible with Microsoft Windows series of operating systems.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n'Anwar' is licensed under Apache License Version V2.
