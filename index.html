<p>Anwar is a simple, lightweight tool that gives you the power to build your own development environment in VIM.

<p>Anwar is a CLI(Command Line Interface) program that simplifies the process of creating a custom VIM based IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for everyone, especially those new to developing on Ubuntu.</p>
